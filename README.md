# Water Mission Image Reading Service

This repository contains the code for reading data from images as part of the Water Mission project. The primary goal is to improve the accuracy of AI readings by ensuring high-quality input images and refining the analysis process.

## Overview

The current implementation includes:

1. A service to read image data.
2. A batch processing script for handling output.

## Primary Analysis

You can view a basic analysis done with the current setup here. This provides a baseline for further improvements.
